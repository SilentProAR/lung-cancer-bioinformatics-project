# RNA-seq Differential Expression Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on differential gene expression analysis using publicly available RNA-seq datasets. The aim is to identify genes that are significantly upregulated or downregulated between disease and control samples.

## Dataset
- Source: TCGA-LUAD
- Dataset ID: ENSGXXXXX (to be finalized)
- Organism: Homo sapiens
- Data type: RNA-seq count data

## Objectives
- Preprocess and clean RNA-seq expression data
- Perform normalization and basic statistical analysis
- Visualize gene expression patterns using Python
- Build a reproducible analysis workflow
- Attempt druggability testing using AutoDock and User uploads using ML.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Current Status
Ongoing – data preprocessing and exploratory analysis in progress.

## Future Work
- Differential expression testing
- Pathway and functional enrichment analysis
